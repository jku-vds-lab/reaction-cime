## Encoding
In the "Encoding" tab panel users can change the marks and channels of the displayed data.
- **shape by**: select a categorical feature with less than six distinct values and encode each value as a different mark 
- **opacity by**: select a numerical feature and scale the opacity of each point by that value; the upper and lower limit of the brightness can be adjusted with the scale below; if nothing is selected, the slider can be adjusted to set the general opacity value of all points
- **size by**: select a numerical feature and scale the size of each point by that value; the upper and lower limit of the size can be adjusted with the scale below; if nothing is selected, the slider can be adjusted to set the general size value of all points
- **color by**: select a categorical or numerical feature that defines the color of the points; the colormap can be chosen below and depends on whether the feature is numerical or categorical
